# TheLocalShop
## Project Name: E-Commerce Website

### Deliverable
Develop an e-commerce website dedicated to selling locally made products from local manufacturers.
The website will allow local artisans, small businesses, and manufacturers to list their products, while
customers can browse, purchase, and provide feedback. The platform will include secure payment
processing, inventory management, and a user-friendly interface for both buyers and sellers.

### Business Case
#### Business Proposition:
The goal of the E-Commerce Platform is to create a digital marketplace that exclusively promotes and
sells products made locally. Many small businesses in the area lack an online presence, limiting their
ability to reach a broader audience. This project will address that gap by offering a scalable and
accessible solution, enhancing the visibility of local products and contributing to the local economy.

#### Key Benefits:
- Expanding the customer base for local businesses.
- Increasing revenue for local artisans and manufacturers.
- Enhancing the local economy by promoting locally sourced products.
- Offering customers a unique shopping experience that supports the community.
